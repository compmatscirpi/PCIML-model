# PCIML-model
Physics- and chemistry-informed machine learning models for predicting Young's modulus of oxide glasses.

Physics- and chemistry-informed machine learning models were trained by using descriptors in the element physical and chemical properties domain, which include stoichiometric, elemental-property-based, valance orbital occupation, and ionicity features. 

Here, you will find first, a trained artificial neural network model "pickle_model.pkl" as a binary file for Scikit-Learn. Second, a Python script "youngs.py" was used for data pre-processing and executed the trained model. Third, an input data file "condition", which was obtained by converting the chemical composition domain of glasses to the element physical and chemical properties domain.
